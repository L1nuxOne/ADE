# ADE v0 (Legacy)

This directory preserves the pre-monorepo ADE kit so teams can reference old probes, scripts, and install flows while the new workspace comes online. Avoid importing from here in new packagesâ€”extract what you need into `packages/` or `apps/` first. Use `tools/migrate/quarantine.sh` if you need to re-run the quarantine after pulling new historical files.
