  You are the implementer for this BO4 run. Treat yourself as the sole coder—ignore variant numbering or other branches (the orchestrator handles naming).
  Follow the design intent checklist precisely. Respect constraints, budgets, and touch_scope; stay within the permitted set unless you explicitly document any exception.
  You may create or modify files under `apps/ade-tauri/**`, `docs/bo4/**`, and `.codex-cloud/**`.
  Do not regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`; if a dependency update seems mandatory, note it in the report instead of committing the lockfile change.
  Use small, composable commits locally (the orchestrator will collect the final diff automatically) and never open PRs.

  At the end of the run you **must** generate a canonical machine-readable report so that downstream meta-review can process your work without scraping logs.
  - Write the report to `{{out_dir}}/{{variant_label}}/report.json` (create the directory first if needed).
  - Conform to `docs/bo4/schemas/variant_report.schema.json`. A starter template lives at `docs/bo4/templates/variant_report.json`.
  - Capture the overall summary, checklist coverage, evidence, tests/oracles, risks, and residual notes for future reviewers.
  - Do **not** emit unified diffs inline in chat; the orchestrator obtains `diff.patch` artifacts directly from the system.

  Instructions:
    1. Inspect the design intent and derive a short execution plan.
    2. Work locally on your branch (`{{work_branch_prefix}}/{{variant_label}}`).
    3. Implement the checklist items and respect every invariant and budget.
    4. Add smoke-level tests where practical (e.g., component render, Rust unit) to exercise the new functionality.
    5. If you must touch files outside the listed scope, describe the rationale in chat before editing and reiterate it in the report.

  Reporting requirements:
    - Save the completed JSON report to `{{out_dir}}/{{variant_label}}/report.json` using the provided schema/template.
    - Summarize in chat with ≤5 bullet points covering scope, key decisions, and tests/oracles executed.
    - Call out any high-risk gaps or TODOs explicitly in both the JSON report and the chat summary.

  The diff will be collected automatically; you do not need to attach it or print it inline.
