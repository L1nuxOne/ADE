title: "Milestone X â€“ Feature Y"
summary: >
  High-level goal in one paragraph summarizing scope and desired outcome.
checklist:
  - id: P1
    name: "Implement L1 detectors (endpoint, function, datamodel...)"
    importance: MUST          # MUST | SHOULD | NICE
    acceptance:
      - "Scan completes < 5s on a medium repo"
      - "Writes .codex-ide/index/l1_catalogue.json"
      - "Evidence spans include file + byte offsets"
    targets:
      l2: ["epistemology/endpoint/*", "logic/function/*"]
    non_goals:
      - "No tree-sitter yet; ripgrep-first"
  - id: P2
    name: "Crosswalk & reconciliation vs enriched.json"
    importance: MUST
    acceptance:
      - "Produces crosswalk.json with roles and confidences"
      - "Green/yellow/red states computed"
constraints:
  invariants:
    - "No submodules. No destructive history rewrites."
    - "L0 precedence: Ontology > Methodology > Epistemology > Logic (first match wins)."
